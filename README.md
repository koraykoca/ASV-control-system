# ASV-control-system

Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) Remote Control System Implementation using Arduino microcontroller, Xbee Pro RF modules, Polulu MC33926 Motor Controller, Seabotix BT-150 Thrusters and Maxbotics sonar range sensors. The codes were written in C/C++. ASV can perform three selectable functions: remote control, autonomous control and fire fighting.
