Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) Remote Control System Implementation using Arduino microcontroller, Xbee Pro RF modules and NRF modules, Polulu MC33926 Motor Controller, Seabotix BT-150 Thrusters and Maxbotics sonar range sensors. The codes were written in C/C++. ASV can perform three selectable functions: remote control, autonomous control and fire fighting. The whole project can be read as pdf through [this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WhQaoMav3XJpzK_8vnc5pgq01tOeKQWn/view?usp=sharing)
